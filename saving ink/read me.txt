Problem 8: Saving ink
? Susan likes to make a line drawing with ink. There ¡®re several
dots on drawing paper. Your job is to tell Susan how to
connect the dots so as to minimize the amount of ink used.
? Susan connects the dots by drawing straight lines between pairs,
possibly lifting the pen between lines.
? When Susan is done there must be a sequence of connected lines
from any dot to any other dot.
? Test using 3 different data sets (test cases).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input
? The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself
indicating the number of dots (0<n<30) on drawing paper. For each
dots, a line follows; each following line contains two real numbers
indicating the (x, y) coordinates of the dots.
? Output
? Your program must print a single real number to two decimal places:
the minimum total length of ink lines that can connect all the dots.
