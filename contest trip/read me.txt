Problem 9: Contest trip
? Tomorrow morning Tina must travel from Seoul to Daejeon to compete in the regional
programming contest.
? Since she is afraid of arriving late and being excluded from the contest, she is looking for the train
which gets her to Daejeon as early as possible.
? However, she dislikes getting to the station too early, so if there are several schedules with the
same arrival time then she will choose the one with the latest departure time.
? Tina asks you to help her with her problem. You are given a set of railroad schedules from
which you must compute the train with the earliest arrival time and the fastest connection
from one location to another.
? Fortunately, is very experienced in changing trains and can do this instantaneously, i.e., in zero
time!
? Test Using 3 Different Data Sets (test cases).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input
? Each schedule consists of three parts. The first part lists the
names of all cities connected by the railroads. It starts with a
number 1 < C ? 100, followed by C lines containing city names. All
names consist only of letters.
? The second part describes all the trains running during a day. It
starts with a number T ? 100 followed by T train descriptions.
Each of them consists of one line with a number ti ? 100 and then
ti more lines, each with a time and a city name, meaning that
passengers can get on or off the train at that time at that city.
? The final part consists of three lines: the first containing the
earliest possible starting time, the second the name of the city
where she starts, and the third with the destination city. The start
and destination cities are always different.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Output
? If a connection exists, print the two lines containing zero padded
timestamps and locations as shown in the example. Use blanks to
achieve the indentation. If no connection exists on the same day
(i.e., arrival before midnight), print a line containing ¡°No
connection¡±.
