Problem 4: Distinct Subsequences
? A subsequence of a given sequence S consists of S with zero
or more elements deleted. Formally, a sequence Z = z1 z2 ・ zk
is a subsequence of X = x1 x2 ・ xm if there exists a strictly
increasing sequence < i1 i2 ・ ik > of indices of X such that for
all j = 1, 2, ・, k, we have xij = zj.
? For example, Z = bcdb is a subsequence of X = abcbdab
with corresponding index sequence < 2, 3, 5, 7 >.
? Your job is to write a program that counts the number of
occurrences of Z in X as a subsequence such that each has a
distinct index sequence.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input
? The first line of the input contains an integer N indicating the
number of test cases to follow.
? The first line of each test case contains a string X, composed entirely
of lowercase alphabetic characters and having length no greater
than 10,000.
? The second line contains another string Z having length no greater
than 100 and also composed of only lowercase alphabetic characters.
? Be assured that neither Z nor any prefix or suffix of Z will have more
than 10100 distinct occurrences in X as a subsequence.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Output
? For each test case, output the number of distinct
occurrences of Z in X as a subsequence.
? Output for each input set must be on a separate line.
