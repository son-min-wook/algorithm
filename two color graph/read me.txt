Problem 17: two-color graph
」 The four-color theorem states that every planar map can be 
colored using only four colors in such a way that no region is
colored using the same color as a neighbor.
」 After being open for over 100 years, the theorem was proven in
1976 with the assistance of a computer. Here you are asked to solve
a simpler problem.
」 Decide whether a given connected graph can be two-color graph, i.e.,
can the vertices be painted red and black such that no two adjacent
vertices have the same color.
」 To simplify the problem, you can assume the graph will be
connected, undirected, and not contain self-loops (i.e., edges
from a vertex to itself).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input
」 The first line contains the number of edges . (1<n_edge<30)
」 Each case starts with a line containing the number of vertices n,
where 1<n<30.
」 Each vertex in labeled by a number from 0 to n-1.
」 After this, lines follow, each containing two vertex numbers
specifying an edge. An input with n = 0 marks the end of the input
and is not to be processed.
」 Output
」 Decide whether the input graph can be 2-colored, and print the
result as shown below.
