Problem 12: The RSA Problem
」 Alice and Bob agree on an encryption method and a shared key.
」 Alice encrypts a plaintext M for Bob using Bob¨s public key(n, e)
by computing the ciphertext C = Me (mod n).
」 Given an RSA public Key (n, e) and a ciphertext C Me (mod n),
to compute M(original message).
」 To solve the RSA Problem an adversary, who doesn¨t know the
private key, must nonetheless invert the RSA function.
